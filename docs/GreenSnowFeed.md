## About the connector
GreenSnow is a threat intelligence feed service that delivers information on various cybersecurity threats. It provides data on indicators of compromise (IoCs), including IP addresses. The service collects a substantial number of IP addresses from computers located around the world. This connector facilitates automated operations such as indicators.<br/><br/>This connector has a dependency on the <a href="/content-hub/all-content/?contentType=solutionpack&amp;tag=ThreatIntelManagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Threat Intel Management Solution Pack</a>. Install the Solution Pack before enabling ingestion of Threat Feeds from this source.
<p>This document provides information about the GreenSnow Feed Connector, which facilitates automated interactions, with a GreenSnow Feed server using FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks. Add the GreenSnow Feed Connector as a step in FortiSOAR&trade; playbooks and perform automated operations with GreenSnow Feed.</p>

## Installing the connector
<p>Use the <strong>Content Hub</strong> to install the connector. For the detailed procedure to install a connector, click <a href="https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/0.0.0/installing-a-connector/1/installing-a-connector" target="_top">here</a>.</p><p>You can also use the <code>yum</code> command as a root user to install the connector:</p>
<pre>yum install cyops-connector-greensnow-feed</pre>

## Prerequisites to configuring the connector
- You must have the credentials of GreenSnow Feed server to which you will connect and perform automated operations.
- The FortiSOAR&trade; server should have outbound connectivity to port 443 on the GreenSnow Feed server.

## Minimum Permissions Required
- Not applicable

## Configuring the connector
For the procedure to configure a connector, click [here](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/fortisoar/0.0.0/configuring-a-connector/1/configuring-a-connector)
### Configuration parameters
<p>In FortiSOAR&trade;, on the Connectors page, click the <strong>GreenSnow Feed</strong> connector row (if you are in the <strong>Grid</strong> view on the Connectors page) and in the <strong>Configurations</strong> tab enter the required configuration details:</p>
<table border=1><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Server URL</td><td>Specify the URL of the GreenSnow server to connect and perform automated operations.
</td>
</tr><tr><td>Verify SSL</td><td>Specifies whether the SSL certificate for the server is to be verified or not. <br/>By default, this option is set to True.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

## Actions supported by the connector
The following automated operations can be included in playbooks and you can also use the annotations to access operations from FortiSOAR&trade; release 4.10.0 and onwards:
<table border=1><thead><tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th><th>Annotation and Category</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Get Indicators</td><td>Retrieves a list of all indicators from SnowFeed Feed.</td><td>get_indicators <br/>Investigation</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

### operation: Get Indicators
#### Input parameters
None.

#### Output

 No output schema is available at this time.
## Included playbooks
The `Sample - GreenSnow Feed - 1.0.0` playbook collection comes bundled with the GreenSnow Feed connector. These playbooks contain steps using which you can perform all supported actions. You can see bundled playbooks in the **Automation** > **Playbooks** section in FortiSOAR&trade; after importing the GreenSnow Feed connector.

- GreenSnow Feed > Fetch and Create
- Get Indicators
- GreenSnow Feed > Ingest

**Note**: If you are planning to use any of the sample playbooks in your environment, ensure that you clone those playbooks and move them to a different collection since the sample playbook collection gets deleted during connector upgrade and delete.

## Data Ingestion Support

Use the Data Ingestion Wizard to easily ingest data into FortiSOAR™ by pulling data from GreenSnow Feed. Currently, data from GreenSnow Feed are mapped to "threat intel feeds" in FortiSOAR™. For more information on the Data Ingestion Wizard, see the "Connectors Guide" in the FortiSOAR™ product documentation.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin ingesting data into FortiSOAR, it is strongly recommended that you deploy and set up the Threat Intel Management Solution Pack, since, by default, data ingestion is mapped to the Threat Intel Feed modules.

### Configure Data Ingestion

You can configure data ingestion using the “Data Ingestion Wizard” to seamlessly map the incoming GreenSnow Feed data to FortiSOAR™ "Threat Intel Feeds". 

The Data Ingestion Wizard enables you to configure the scheduled pulling of data from the GreenSnow Feed into FortiSOAR™. It also lets you pull some sample data from GreenSnow Feed using which you can define the mapping of data between the GreenSnow Feed and FortiSOAR™. The mapping of common fields is generally already done by the Data Ingestion Wizard; users are mostly required to only map any custom fields that are added to the GreenSnow Feed.

1.  To begin configuring data ingestion, click Configure Data Ingestion on the GreenSnow Feed connector’s "Configurations" page.
Click Let’s Start by fetching some data, to open the “Fetch Sample Data” screen.

![](media/start.png)

Sample data is required to create a field mapping between the GreenSnow Feeds and FortiSOAR™. The sample data is pulled from connector actions or ingestion playbooks.

2.  On the Fetch Data screen, provide the configurations required to fetch GreenSnow Feeds. You can pull data from GreenSnow Feed and add custom confidence level, reputation, and TLP to that feed. 

![](media/fetch.png)

The fetched data is used to create a mapping between the GreenSnow Feeds and FortiSOAR™ threat intel feeds. Once you have completed specifying the configurations, click Fetch Data.

3.  On the Field Mapping screen, map the fields of a GreenSnow Feed to the fields of a threat intel feed present in FortiSOAR™.
To map a field, click the key in the sample data to add the “jinja” value of the field. For example, to map the ip parameter of a GreenSnow Feed to the value parameter of a FortiSOAR™ threat intel feed, click the value field, and then click the ip field to populate its keys:

For more information on field mapping, see the Data Ingestion chapter in the "Connectors Guide" in the FortiSOAR™ product documentation. Once you have completed mapping the fields, click Save Mapping & Continue.

4.  Use the Scheduling screen to configure schedule-based ingestion, i.e., specify the polling frequency to GreenSnow Feed, so that the content gets pulled from the GreenSnow Feed integration into FortiSOAR™.
On the Scheduling screen, from the Do you want to schedule the ingestion? drop-down list, select Yes.
In the “Configure Schedule Settings” section, specify the Cron expression for the schedule. For example, if you want to pull data from GreenSnow Feed every morning at 5 am, click Daily, and in the hour box enter 5 , and in the minute box enter 0:

Once you have completed scheduling, click Save Settings & Continue.

5.  The Summary screen displays a summary of the mapping done, and it also contains links to the Ingestion playbooks. Click Done to complete the data ingestion, and exit the Data Ingestion Wizard.
